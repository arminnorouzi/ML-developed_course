        "\n",
        "In the previous section, we learn what GAN is and how it works. Now let's see what is transformers and why we need such a thing.\n",
        "\n",
        "We learned GAN is a type of neural network that consists of two networks, a **generator** and a **discriminator**. The generator tries to create new data samples that are similar to the input data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between the real and fake data samples. The two networks are trained together in a way that the generator learns to create more realistic samples while the discriminator gets better at distinguishing between the real and fake samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the **Transformer** is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the field of natural language processing (NLP). It is mainly used for tasks such as **language translation**, **text summarization**, and **language modelling**. The Transformer model consists of an **encoder** and a **decoder** that work together to process input sequences and generate output sequences. The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a hidden representation of the input. The decoder then takes the hidden representation and generates the output sequence. The Transformer uses a **self-attention mechanism** that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence while processing it. Additionally, the Transformer uses a **positional encoding technique** to preserve the order of the input sequence, which is important for language tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "While both models are used for different tasks, they do share some similarities. Both GAN and Transformer are deep learning models that are based on neural networks and use backpropagation to train their parameters. Additionally, they both have been used for generating realistic images and natural language text.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the key difference between the two models is that GAN is used for generative tasks, while the Transformer is used for tasks related to natural language processing. **GANs generate new samples, while Transformers transform input sequences into output sequences.**\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1.2. We have RNN and LSTM; why do we need transformers?\n",
        "\n",
        "While RNNs and LSTMs are powerful models that have been used successfully in many natural language processing tasks, they have certain limitations that can make them less effective for certain tasks. Here are a few reasons why Transformers have emerged as an important alternative to RNNs and LSTMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Long-term dependencies:** RNNs and LSTMs are designed to capture sequential dependencies in data, which makes them well-suited for modeling time-series data or sequences of variable length. However, they can struggle to capture long-term dependencies in data, particularly when the distance between the relevant elements in the sequence is large. Transformers are designed to explicitly model long-range dependencies using self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture long-term relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Parallelization:** RNNs and LSTMs process data sequentially, which can make them slower and more computationally expensive than other models. Transformers, on the other hand, can process the entire input sequence in parallel, which makes them more efficient and faster to train. This is particularly important for large-scale natural language processing tasks that involve processing large amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Handling variable-length inputs:** RNNs and LSTMs are designed to handle input sequences of variable length, but they can struggle with very long sequences or sequences that contain significant amounts of noise or irrelevant information. Transformers are better suited for handling variable-length inputs and can effectively filter out noise or irrelevant information using their attention mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Attention-based mechanisms:** Transformers are designed to use attention-based mechanisms, which allow them to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence based on the context of the task. This makes them particularly well-suited for tasks that require the model to selectively attend to different parts of the input sequence, such as machine translation or question answering."

        "\n",
        "We briefly talked about the transformer component; let's dive into it in more detail. \n",
        "\n",
        "![picture](https://github.com/arminnorouzi/machine_learning_course_UofA_MECE610/blob/main/L07_Generative_AI/figures/transformers.png?raw=true) Source: [1-2]\n",
        "\n",
        "This figure shows transformers architecture schematically. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, which are composed of multiple layers that use attention and self-attention mechanisms to process the input and output sequences. The positional encoding technique is used to encode the position of tokens in the input sequence. These components work together to enable the Transformer to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Encoder:** The encoder is the part of the Transformer architecture that processes the input sequence and produces a hidden representation of the sequence. The input sequence is first transformed into a sequence of embeddings, which are then fed into a stack of identical layers. Each layer in the encoder stack consists of two sublayers: a self-attention layer and a feedforward layer. The self-attention layer allows the encoder to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture long-range dependencies, while the feedforward layer applies a nonlinear transformation to the hidden representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decoder:** The decoder is the part of the Transformer architecture that generates the output sequence based on the hidden representation produced by the encoder. Like the encoder, the decoder also consists of a stack of identical layers, but each layer has three sublayers: a self-attention layer, an encoder-decoder attention layer, and a feedforward layer. The self-attention layer allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the output sequence, while the encoder-decoder attention layer allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the input sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Attention:** Attention is a mechanism in neural networks that allows the model to selectively attend to different parts of the input when making a prediction. In the Transformer architecture, attention is used in both the encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism calculates a weighted sum of the values of the input sequence, where the weights are determined by the similarity between the query and the keys. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence depending on the task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Self-attention is a specific type of attention mechanism that is used in the Transformer architecture. In self-attention, the input sequence is transformed into a sequence of query, key, and value vectors. The query vectors are used to calculate the attention weights for each position in the input sequence, based on the similarity between the query vector and the key vectors. The value vectors are then weighted by the attention weights and summed up to produce a weighted representation of the input sequence. This weighted representation is then used as the input for the next layer of the model. Self-attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture long-range dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Positional Encoding:** Positional encoding is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to encode the position of the tokens in the input sequence. Since the Transformer does not have a recurrence or convolutional structure that can capture the order of the input sequence, the positional encoding is added to each token's embedding to provide the model with information about the position of the token in the sequence. The positional encoding is calculated using a fixed function that takes into account the position of the token in the sequence and the dimension of the embedding. The result is then added to the token's embedding, allowing the model to differentiate between tokens that appear in different positions in the input sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For learning how these componenet working in a big picture, I refer you to [Google AI Blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html):\n",
        "\n",
        "> Neural networks for machine translation typically contain an encoder reading the input sentence and generating a representation of it. A decoder then generates the output sentence word by word while consulting the representation generated by the encoder. The Transformer starts by generating initial representations, or embeddings, for each word... Then, using self-attention, it aggregates information from all of the other words, generating a new representation per word informed by the entire context, represented by the filled balls. This step is then repeated multiple times in parallel for all words, successively generating new representations.\n",

Additionally, the `use_causal_mask` argument of the mha method is set to `True`, which applies a causal mask to the attention scores to **ensure that the model can only attend to previous time steps**.\n",
